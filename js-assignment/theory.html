Q17.What are the disadvantages of using innerHTML in JavaScript? <br>
ANS=If you use innerHTML in JavaScript the disadvantage is
Content is replaced everywhere,
We cannot use like "appending to innerHTML",
Even if you use +=like "innerHTML = innerHTML + 'html'" still the old content is replaced by html,
The entire innerHTML content is re-parsed and build into elements, therefore its much slower,
The innerHTML does not provide validation and therefore we can potentially insert valid and broken HTML in the document and break it <br>
